I'm a Master student at the [Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department, University of California-San Diego](http://www.ece.ucsd.edu). I am supervised by [Prof. Truong Q. Nguyen](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=48) at the [Video Processing Lab](http://videoprocessing.ucsd.edu). I received my B.S. Degree from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/). My Research interests are computer vision and machine learning.

## Drives' Gaze Estimaion

Driving safety is an increasingly important issue studied by many researchers. According to the 
Critical Reasons for Crashes Survey by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 
almost 94% of crashes are due to Driver-Related Critical Reasons, such as errors related to 
recognition, decision and performance, distraction, fatigue, etc.

Existing works focusing on the gaze estimation put the human face in front of the screen and develop 
the deep learning algorithm for gaze vector estimation accordingly. The main drawback of these 
existing works is that collected datasets capture only the participants at the center of the image 
which is not as in the real driving scenario. Our dataset would stimulate the real driving conditions 
and fix the camera at the same location as the rear-view mirror. Therefore, the human face will only 
take a small portion of the whole image. This project would give a processing frame of the gaze estimation 
in the real situation.
